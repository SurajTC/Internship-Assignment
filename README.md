## âš¡ Automobile Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

### Problem Statement

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Automobile sales are on a global increase, so there is a need for car price
prediction system to effectively determine the worthiness of the car using a variety
of features.

### Objective

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
To predict the retail price of a car by training different machine learning
regression models on the given dataset and evaluate the performance of individual
models to select the one with high accuracy to maximize the efficiency of price
prediction system.
